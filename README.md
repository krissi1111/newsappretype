## NewsApp - frontend

This is the frontend of my News App project.
It is meant to be run in conjunction with the backend [here](https://github.com/krissi1111/NewsAppNet).

In order to run the frontend you can clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. 
Before running you will need to type:

### `npm install`

and after that you can run it by calling:

### `npm start`

The frontend will run on localhost using port 3000

### `http://localhost:3000/`
